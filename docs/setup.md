# South Bay Fusion Audio

## Setup

### 1. Remove Equipment

Remove the following equipment from our storage area:

* 1x "Audio Rack"
* 1x Folding table
* 1x Black tablecloth
* 4x Behringer B212D speakers
* 2x speaker stands
* 4x XLR cables
* 4x Power cables

### 2. Set up DJ Booth

Set up the folding table on the west side of the room. Add the tablecloth. Center with the wall segment between the entryway and closet door. Center with the stage stairs.

Place Audio Rack on the table edge nearest the stage. Unwind power cables and audio input cables.

### 3. Prepare Speakers

On the back side of each speaker, set the following settings:

* LEVEL to 10 o' clock
* HIGH to 12 o'clock (straight up)
* LOW to 12 o'clock (straight up)
* POWER to OFF

Each knob should have yellow guide lines. Simply align the yellow lines.

### 4. Prepare Stands

Expand the two speaker stands using the yellow guide lines.

Ensure that the safety pin is in place and most knobs are tightened. One knob is completely broken, but the safety pin should keep the stand upright. The other knobs are fragile (don't overtighten).

### 5. Place Front Speakers

Face the stage. Place Speaker A on the right (east) side.

Place Speaker B on the left (west) side. Both speakers should "target" the window on the south side of the room. This is not an ideal placement, but it's the best we can do with our current equipment.

### 6. Place Rear Speakers

Find the emergency exit on the east side of the room. There is a window to the immediate south. Place the stand such that the center pole is in line with the southern edge of the window. Place Speaker C on top of the stand.

Place Speaker D on the opposite side of the room. Roughly align to Speaker C. Note that Speaker D is falling apart: feet are missing, the grill is bent, and the XLR input is damaged. Please be gentle with Speaker D.
